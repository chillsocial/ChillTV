# CHILLTV LICENSE INFORMATION

Last deployed March 26th, 2022 (3/26/2022 US-Formatted, 26/3/2022 Int'l-Formatted).

This is a legally-binding agreement between you (you, your) and the developer (she, her). By viewing, interacting with or using any portion of the ChillTV source code (whatever comes first), you agree to these terms. By breaking this ToS, you are running an unauthorized instance of ChillTV and, if your unauthorized instance is made public, your instance is subject to recieve a copyright strike and legal reprecutions may occur.

This policy may change at anytime, and it is your responsibility to comply with the latest version of this policy.

## 1. CHANGING AND ALTERING OF THE SOURCE CODE
- **You are not allowed to place any front-end advertisements.** This includes but is not limited to traditional ads (click/tap to go to website/app) and annoying ads (popups, redirects, "jEsSiCa Is TwO mIlEs AwAy" type ads). You can place a donate link anywhere besides the `feed.php` file, however it must not be so big that it disrupts the user interface and you cannot lock ChillTV behind a paywall. You can also use back-end advertisements (such as ArcIO) that don't display anything.
- **You are not allowed to alter the feed.php file.** This file displays the video feed and should not display anything else.
- **You are not allowed to pass off ChillTV as your own.** You can't put `(C)YEAR Your_name_here` anywhere. If you want to, you have to use `(C)2022-Present <a href="https://github.com/chillsocial/ChillTV">ChillTV</a>, an open source project. Some rights reserved. This instance hosted by Your_name_here.`.

## 2. USING CHILLTV CODE FOR THIRD-PARTY PROJECTS
I'm happy that you want to use my code for your own project! You are welcome to, as long as you clearly link to ChillTV's Github page (`https://github.com/chillsocial/ChillTV`) and say you used some of my code. You can not pass off a third-party project as a ChillTV instance. You also cannot place any ads (including back-end ads) wherever ChillTV code is placed.

## 3. COLLECTION, SELLING AND REDISTRIBUTION OF USER DATA
- **For ChillTV Instances** - You are allowed to collect user data for the sole purpose of analytics through an analytics provider (such as Google Analytics or AddThis). You cannot sell any of this data, and you can only redistribute this data with law enforcement if required to do so.
- **For Third-Party Projects** - You are not allowed to collect, sell or redistribute user data.

I am aware that some hosting providers and servers (such as Nginx) collect a user's IP and User Agent, this is okay as long as you don't sell or redistribute this data and you must make it clear that this data is being collected.

## 4. LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY SITES AND APPS
- You cannot use links as a form of advertising.
- If you get a commission, money, crypto, stock, in-app/in-site currency or any other form of reward from the link (financial or not), as per FTC requirements, you must disclose this on the page the link is on.
- If the link contains ads, you must disclose this on the page the link is on.
